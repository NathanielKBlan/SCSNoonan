*Statements are always read from left to right by compiler.

---The Onion of Programming---
1 = center.
1. Var / members / objects
2. Operations
3. Statements
4. Functions / Methods (These can only have one output);
5. Class
6. Library

In programming you go from the center of the onion to the outside.

---Three classes of operators---
1. Math operators: +, -, *, /, %
2. Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, results in 1 or 0
3. Logical Boolean operators: && (=D-), || (=)>-), ! (-|>-)
